# TODO: Analysis Results & Visualization Issues

## ‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT STATUS: WORKING
- Data source connection: ‚úÖ Working (loads NCC dataset)
- API endpoints: ‚úÖ Working (all /api/* routes functional)
- Environment variables: ‚úÖ Configured in Vercel
- Frontend/backend communication: ‚úÖ Fixed

## üö® CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. Results Tab - "No analysis results available"
**Problem:** The Results tab is empty despite successful data loading and API connectivity.
- ‚úÖ Data source connection working (NCC dataset loads properly)
- ‚úÖ API endpoints responding correctly
- ‚ùå Analysis results not populating in Results tab
- **Previous state:** Used to show tables of analysis results

**Investigation needed:**
- Check if GPT-4.1 analysis requests are being made
- Verify analysis response format matches frontend expectations
- Review UnifiedAnalysisView component handling of analysis results

### 2. Visualization Tab - Missing Charts/Tables  
**Problem:** Visualization tab not rendering charts or data tables.
- **Previous state:** Showed interactive charts and data visualizations
- **Current state:** Empty/broken visualization rendering
- **Impact:** Users cannot see visual representation of analysis

**Investigation needed:**
- Check if chart.js/recharts components are receiving data
- Verify data format compatibility with visualization components
- Test ChartVisualization component functionality

### 3. Interpretation Tab - Needs Better Precision
**Problem:** Analysis interpretations lack precision and insight quality.
- **Issue:** Model outputs are not providing actionable business insights
- **Need:** More precise prompting for GPT-4.1 model
- **Goal:** Generate specific, data-driven interpretations

**Investigation needed:**
- Review current prompts sent to GPT-4.1
- Analyze quality of interpretation responses
- Improve prompt engineering for business context

## üîç Technical Investigation Areas

### API Analysis Flow
- [ ] Test `/api/ai-query` endpoint directly
- [ ] Verify GPT-4.1 agent orchestration is working
- [ ] Check analysis request/response format
- [ ] Review streaming analysis service functionality

### Frontend Components
- [ ] Debug `UnifiedAnalysisView.jsx` component
- [ ] Check `AIAnalysisResults.jsx` for data handling
- [ ] Verify `ChartVisualization.jsx` component
- [ ] Test results data flow from API to UI

### Data Pipeline
- [ ] Confirm analysis data structure matches UI expectations
- [ ] Verify cached dataset is properly passed to analysis
- [ ] Check if analysis results are being stored correctly
- [ ] Review data transformation between backend and frontend

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Results Tab Should Show:
- [ ] Tabular data with analysis results
- [ ] Summary statistics and insights
- [ ] Filtered/aggregated data based on user queries
- [ ] Export functionality for results

### Visualization Tab Should Show:
- [ ] Interactive charts (bar, line, pie charts)
- [ ] Data tables with sorting/filtering
- [ ] Visual representations of trends and patterns
- [ ] Responsive chart rendering

### Interpretation Tab Should Provide:
- [ ] Specific business insights from data
- [ ] Actionable recommendations
- [ ] Context-aware analysis based on NCC financial data
- [ ] Clear explanations of data patterns

## üîß Immediate Action Items

1. **Debug Analysis Pipeline:**
   ```bash
   # Test analysis endpoint directly
   curl -X POST https://beaconv3.vercel.app/api/ai-query \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"question": "show me top offices by NCC", "dataset": "ncc"}'
   ```

2. **Review Component Structure:**
   - Check UnifiedAnalysisView props and state
   - Verify data flow from analysis service
   - Test individual visualization components

3. **Improve Prompting:**
   - Review current GPT-4.1 prompts in gpt4AgentOrchestrator
   - Add business context for NCC financial analysis
   - Include specific output format requirements

## üèÜ Previous Working State Reference

**What worked before:**
- Results tab showed data tables with analysis results
- Visualization tab rendered charts and graphs
- Analysis pipeline processed user queries and returned insights

**What needs to be restored:**
- Full analysis results pipeline from query ‚Üí GPT-4.1 ‚Üí frontend display
- Chart rendering with real NCC financial data
- Business intelligence insights based on actual dataset
