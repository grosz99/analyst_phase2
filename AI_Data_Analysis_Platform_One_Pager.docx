# AI-Powered Data Analysis Platform: Transforming Global Services

**The Bottleneck**: 
- Analysts wait days for IT to extract data
- Business users can't explore data independently  
- Questions require custom SQL queries and technical expertise
- Reports are static snapshots, not interactive explorations
